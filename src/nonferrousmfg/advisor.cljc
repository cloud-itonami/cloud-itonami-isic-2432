(ns nonferrousmfg.advisor
  "NonFerrousFoundryAdvisor -- the *contained intelligence node* for
  the non-ferrous metal casting foundry plant-operations coordination
  actor.

  It normalizes production-batch patches (alloy-grade/weight/defect-
  rate), drafts a furnace/mold/shakeout/die-casting-equipment
  maintenance scheduling proposal against a piece of equipment, drafts
  a safety-concern flag, and drafts an outbound aluminum/copper/zinc/
  brass/bronze/magnesium casting shipment coordination proposal
  against a production batch. CRITICAL: it is a smart-but-untrusted
  advisor. It returns a *proposal* (with a rationale + the fields it
  cited), never a committed record and NEVER a real furnace/die-
  casting-machine/pouring-line actuation or freight dispatch. Every
  output is censored downstream by `nonferrousmfg.governor` before
  anything touches the SSoT -- see README `What this actor does NOT
  do`.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end. In production this calls a real LLM (kotoba-llm or
  equivalent) with the same proposal shape.

  Proposal shape (all kinds):

  CRITICAL invariant this advisor upholds: every request it is asked to
  route MUST itself carry `:effect :propose` (the request-level
  contract every caller of this actor agrees to) --
  `nonferrousmfg.governor` HARD-holds any request that doesn't, so a
  mis-wired caller can never reach a commit path even if this advisor
  were compromised."
