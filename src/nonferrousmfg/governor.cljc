  "Non-Ferrous Foundry Plant Operations Governor -- the independent
  compliance layer that earns the NonFerrousFoundryAdvisor the right
  to commit. The advisor has no notion of whether a piece of equipment
  it wants to schedule maintenance against has actually been
  inspected/registered, whether a batch it wants to coordinate a
  shipment against has actually been QC-verified/registered, whether a
  maintenance proposal secretly tries to ACTUATE (rather than merely
  draft-schedule) the melting furnace, die-casting machine, or pouring
  line, whether a shipment proposal's own claimed weight would blow
  through the batch's own logged production weight, or when an act
  stops being a coordination proposal and becomes direct furnace/
  pouring-line-equipment control, so this MUST be a separate system
  able to *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is
  `:nonferrous-foundry-plant-operations-governor` (see
  docs/adr/0001-architecture.md).

  Checks below, ALL HARD violations except the confidence/high-stakes
  gate (SOFT -- asks a human to look, and the human may approve):

    1. Request-level propose-only  -- did the CALLER's own request
                                       actually declare `:effect
                                       :propose`? Any other value is a
                                       mis-wired/compromised caller
                                       trying to bypass proposal-only
                                       mode -- HARD, unconditional,
                                       evaluated BEFORE anything else.
    2. Closed op allowlist         -- is `:op` one of the four ops this
                                       actor is authorized to coordinate?
                                       Anything else -- HARD hold.
    3. Closed effect allowlist     -- is the PROPOSAL's own `:effect`
                                       (what would actually commit) one
                                       of the four propose-shaped
                                       effects? A proposal effect
                                       outside this set (e.g. a
                                       hallucinated `:furnace/actuate`
                                       or `:pouring-line/run`) is the
                                       'direct furnace/pouring-line-
                                       equipment control' scope
                                       violation this actor must NEVER
                                       perform -- HARD, PERMANENT,
                                       unconditional.
    4. Furnace-actuate blocked     -- for `:schedule-maintenance`, does
                                       the proposal's own `:value`

                                       true`? Directly actuating the
                                       melting furnace, die-casting
                                       machine, or pouring line is this
                                       actor's other permanent scope
                                       boundary (see README `What this
                                       actor does NOT do`) -- HARD,
                                       PERMANENT, unconditional. NO
                                       phase and NO human approval can
                                       ever override this (see
                                       `nonferrousmfg.phase`: this op

                                       `:auto` set either -- two
                                       independent layers agree).
    5. Equipment not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced equipment's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true
                                       (`nonferrousmfg.registry/
                                       equipment-ready?`) -- never

                                       rationale about verification/
                                       registration status. Grounded in
                                       this blueprint's own HARD

                                       maintenance must never be
                                       scheduled against equipment
                                       whose own conditions have not
                                       actually been inspected or
                                       whose registration is not
                                       actually on file.
    6. Already scheduled           -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       refuses to schedule the SAME
                                       maintenance record twice, off a
                                       dedicated `:scheduled?` fact
                                       (never a `:status` value).
    7. Batch not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced batch's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true
                                       (`nonferrousmfg.registry/batch-
                                       ready?`) -- never trust the
                                       advisor's own rationale. Also
                                       part of the 'foundry/batch
                                       record' HARD invariant: a
                                       batch's own verified/registered
                                       status is as much a ground-truth
                                       fact as an equipment unit's own.
    8. Shipment weight exceeded    -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the batch's own recorded
                                       `:shipped-weight-kg` plus
                                       the proposal's own claimed
                                       `:weight-kg` would exceed
                                       the batch's own recorded
                                       `:weight-kg`
                                       (`nonferrousmfg.registry/
                                       shipment-weight-exceeded?`) --
                                       ground truth from the batch's
                                       own permanent fields, never a
                                       self-reported weight claim.
    9. Invalid alloy-grade         -- for `:log-production-batch`, if
                                       the patch declares an
                                       `:alloy-grade` outside the
                                       closed known set
                                       (`nonferrousmfg.registry/alloy-

                                       is rejected rather than let a
                                       fabricated alloy grade through.
   10. Invalid defect-rate         -- for `:log-production-batch`, if
